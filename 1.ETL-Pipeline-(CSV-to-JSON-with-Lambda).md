### Simple ETL Pipeline (CSV to JSON with Lambda)

#### Objective: Ingest a CSV uploaded to S3, convert it to JSON, and store the result in a processed bucket using AWS Lambda.

**Steps:**
1. Upload a CSV file to the `s3://your-bucket/raw/` folder.
2. Trigger a Lambda function via S3 event notification.
3. Lambda uses Python + `boto3` to convert to JSON.
4. Store transformed data in `s3://your-bucket/processed/`.
