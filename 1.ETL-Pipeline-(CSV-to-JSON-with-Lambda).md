### Simple ETL Pipeline (CSV to JSON with Lambda)

#### Objective: Ingest a CSV uploaded to S3, convert it to JSON, and store the result in a processed bucket using AWS Lambda.

**Steps:**
1. Upload a CSV file to the `s3://fake-users-bucket-1/raw/` folder,
this is a csv containing 100 rows of realistic user data including user_id, name, email, signup_date and more.

2. Trigger a Lambda function via S3 event notification.
3. Lambda uses Python + `boto3` to convert to JSON.
4. Store transformed data in `s3://your-bucket/processed/`.
