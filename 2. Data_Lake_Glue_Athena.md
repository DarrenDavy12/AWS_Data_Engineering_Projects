### Data Lake with Glue & Athena

### Transform a collection of raw CSV/JSON files into a queryable serverless data lake.

<br>

####  Step 1: Uploaded csv to the raw folder in the S3 bucket to convert into a JSON file shown in the processed folder. 
This allows me to attach data to 'Glue database' to generate table schema based off the data and finally be ready to be uploaded to 'athena' for querying later on in the later steps. 


#### The data is called 'users_activity'

### 1. Organize data in S3 with a partitioned layout (`s3:///data/year=2025/month=07/`).

### 2. Run an AWS Glue Crawler to catalog the data.
### 3. Use Athena to run SQL queries against the catalog.
### 4. Optimize with Parquet + compression.
