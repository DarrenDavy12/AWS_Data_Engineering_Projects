####  Step 1: Uploaded csv to the raw folder in the S3 bucket to convert into a JSON file shown in the processed folder, to get ready to be upload to athena for querying later on in later steps.

### 1. Organize data in S3 with a partitioned layout (`s3:///data/year=2025/month=07/`).

### 2. Run an AWS Glue Crawler to catalog the data.
### 3. Use Athena to run SQL queries against the catalog.
### 4. Optimize with Parquet + compression.
