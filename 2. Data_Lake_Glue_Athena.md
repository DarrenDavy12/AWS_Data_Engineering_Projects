### Data Lake with Glue & Athena

### Transform a collection of raw CSV/JSON files into a queryable serverless data lake.

<br>




####  Step 1: Uploaded csv to the raw folder in the S3 bucket to convert into a JSON file shown in the processed folder. 
This allows me to attach data to 'Glue database' to generate table schema based off the data and finally be ready to be uploaded to 'athena' for querying later on in the later steps. 


#### The data is called 'users_activity'

<br>



#### After the upload was successfull, I went into the processed folder to download the new .JSON file and viewed the file in vscode.

<br>




#### Step 2: Create a role named "AWSGlueServiceRole` with the following permissions:
     - `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`
     - `AWSGlueServiceRole`
     - `AmazonAthenaFullAccess`

#### Run an AWS Glue Crawler to catalog the data

<br>




#### Step 3: Create Glue Database

1. Went to AWS Console → Glue

<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/263aa07b-2a80-44de-b520-df59b8f1fb72)

<br>

2. Clicked on Databases → Add database
   
<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2419d13e-4a29-4773-88a8-6e65853de6a2)

<br>

Named the database 'data_engineering_demo' and left other settings default.

#### Step 4: Create Glue Crawler

<br> 

In Glue Console → Click Crawlers → Add crawler

<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81d27390-d498-4773-94f2-12e2867f0dd7)

<br>

Name: processed_data_crawler

<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f64e7fda-b3d4-4da9-aa71-bea9cc35f3f6)

<br>

Data source:

Choose S3 →

<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/605c5db3-9735-4ddd-87f9-5613b9d0af8a)

<br>

IAM Role: Choose AWSGlueServiceRole

<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5683d0d2-a1d1-42cd-a8a3-f13ab14c7489)

<br>


Output database: Choose data_engineering_demo

<br>

<br>


Finish and Run the crawler

<br>

After that was done, I went to the Tables → confirm a new table like user_activity appears.

<br>






#### Step 4: Use Athena to run SQL queries against the catalog.

<br>

I created a folder in my s3 bucket called 'athena_results' this is the location the query results will kept in. 

<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f651792b-85b5-43c8-950a-a43fc0a10a8c)

<br>

I Went to Athena Console.

<br> 

Assigned the location of the query results to my s3 folder 'athena_results'

<br>

<br>



Chose the database: 'data_engineering_demo'

<br>

Ran this query:

#### Step 5: Optimize with Parquet + compression.
